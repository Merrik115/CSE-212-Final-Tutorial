# Data Structures Tutorial

Welcome to the Data Structures Tutorial. Data structures are a form of organizing and storing data within a program.

- [Stacks](1-stacks.md)
- [Linked Lists](2-linked-list.md)
- [Trees](3-trees.md)

Each module will contain an introduction to the data structure, why it is used, and how it is used. Then there will be an example problem solved in python. Finally, each module will have a tutorial problem for you to solve. A link to the solution will be available at the end of each module.
